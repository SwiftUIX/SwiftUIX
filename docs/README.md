# SwiftUIX Docs
As SwiftUIX grows, the documentation needs to, too.

This folder, or the `docs` folder, is a direct clone of the SwiftUIX wiki. This means you can easily suggest changes to the wiki with a pull request.

## Contributing
Contributing to the wiki is simple.

1. Fork SwiftUIX.
2. `git clone` your fork.
3. Make changes.
4. `git push` the changes.
5. Open a pull request explaining your changes.

Then, once your pull request gets merged, your changes will be moved into the wiki.

### A Couple of Notes

- Make sure to name your files `[concept].md`
  - If there is a space, replace it with a dash.
- Include some example code.
- If you make changes to the code, update the documentation to include your changes (if necessary).
